## Task 2 Introduction to Vulnerabilities

Five main categories of vulnerabilities

* Operating System
* Misconfiguration-based
* Weak or Default Credentials
* Application Logic
* Human-Factor

#### An attacker has been able to upgrade the permissions of their system account from "user" to "administrator". What type of vulnerability is this?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Operating System`
{% endhint %}

#### You manage to bypass a login panel using cookies to authenticate. What type of vulnerability is this?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Application Logic`
{% endhint %}

## Task 3 Scoring Vulnerabilities (CVSS & VPR)

**C**ommon **V**ulnerability **S**coring **S**ystem (CVSS)

* How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability?
* Do exploits exist for this?
* How does this vulnerability interfere with the CIA triad?

**V**ulnerability **P**riority **R**ating (VPR)

* Developed by Tenable
* This framework is considered to be risk-driven

#### What year was the first iteration of CVSS published?

{% hint style="success" %}
`2005`
{% endhint %}

#### If you wanted to assess vulnerability based on the risk it poses to an organization, what framework would you use?

{% hint style="success" %}
`VPR`
{% endhint %}

#### If you wanted to use a framework that was free and open-source, what framework would that be?

{% hint style="success" %}
`CVSS`
{% endhint %}

## Task 4 Vulnerability Databases

#### Using [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing), how many CVEs were submitted in July 2021?

{% hint style="success" %}
`1585`
{% endhint %}

#### Who is the author of[ Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Offensive Security`
{% endhint %}

## Task 5 An Example of Finding a Vulnerability

#### What type of vulnerability did we use to find the name and version of the application in this example?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Version Disclosure`
{% endhint %}

## Task 6 Showcase: Exploiting Ackme's Application

#### Follow along with the showcase of exploiting ACKme's application to the end to retrieve a flag. What is this flag?

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{ACKME_ENGAGEMENT}`
