## Task 2 Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research

#### You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Yay`
{% endhint %}

#### You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database. What vulnerability is this?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Injection`
{% endhint %}

#### You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Broken Access Control`
{% endhint %}

## Task 3 Finding Manual Exploits

#### What website would you use as a security researcher if you wanted to upload a Proof of Concept?

{% hint style="success" %}
`GitHub`
{% endhint %}

#### You are performing a penetration test at a site with no internet connection. What tool could you use to find exploits to use?

{% hint style="success" %}
`searchsploit`
{% endhint %}

## Task 4 Example of Manual Exploitation

#### What type of vulnerability was used in this attack?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Remote Code Execution`
{% endhint %}

## Task 5 Practical: Manual Exploitation

#### Find out the version of the application that is running. What are the name and version number of the application?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Online Book Store v1.0`
{% endhint %}

#### Now use the resources and skills from this module to find an exploit that will allow you to gain **remote access** to the vulnerable machine.

```bash
searchsploit Online Book Store
searchsploit -m 47887
```

#### Use this exploit against the vulnerable machine. What is the value of the flag located in a web directory?

```bash
python3 47887.py http://10.10.164.180/
find / -type f -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null
cat /var/www/html/bootstrap/img/flag.txt
```
