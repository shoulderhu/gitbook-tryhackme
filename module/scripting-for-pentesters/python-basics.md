## Task 2 Hello World

#### On the code editor, print "Hello World". What is the flag?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-40-55.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{PRINT_STATEMENTS}`
{% endhint %}

## Task 3 Mathematical Operators

#### In the code editor, print the result of 21 + 43. What is the flag?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-42-53.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{ADDITI0N}`
{% endhint %}

#### Print the result of 142 - 52. What is the flag?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-43-37.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{SUBTRCT}`
{% endhint %}

#### Print the result of 10 \* 342. What is the flag?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-43-59.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{MULTIPLICATION_PYTHON}`
{% endhint %}

#### Print the result of 5 squared. What is the flag?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-44-29.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{EXP0N3NT_POWER}`
{% endhint %}

## Task 4 Variables and Data Types

#### In the code editor, create a variable called height and set its initial value to 200.

#### On a new line, add 50 to the height variable.

#### On another new line, print out the value of height. What is the flag that appears?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-49-18.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{VARIABL3S}`
{% endhint %}

## Task 6 Introduction to If Statements

#### In this exercise, we will code a small application that calculates and outputs the shipping cost for a customer based on how much they've spent.

#### In the code editor, click on the "shipping.py" tab and follow the instructions to complete this task.

#### Once you've written the application in the code editor's shipping.py tab, a flag will appear, which is the answer to this question.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-55-09.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{IF_STATEMENT_SHOPPING}`
{% endhint %}

#### In shipping.py, on line 12, change the **customer\_basket\_cost** variable to **101** and re-run your code. You will get a flag; the flag is the answer to this question.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-55-47.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{MY_FIRST_APP}`
{% endhint %}

## Task 7 Loops

#### On the code editor, click back on the "script.py" tab and code a loop that outputs every number from 0 to 50.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 21-59-37.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{L00PS_WHILE_FOR}`
{% endhint %}

## Task 8 Introduction to Functions

#### You've invested in Bitcoin and want to write a program that tells you when the value of Bitcoin falls below a particular value in dollars.

#### In the code editor, click on the bitcoin.py tab. Write a function called **bitcoinToUSD** with two parameters: **bitcoin\_amount**, the amount of Bitcoin you own, and **bitcoin\_value\_usd**, the value of bitcoin in USD. The function should return usd\_value, which is your bitcoin value in USD.

#### Once you've written the bitcoinToUSD function, use it to calculate the value of your Bitcoin in USD, and then create an if statement to determine if the value falls below $30,000; if it does, output a message to alert you.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 22-15-16.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{BITC0IN_INVESTOR}`
{% endhint %}

#### 1 Bitcoin is now worth $25,000. In the code editor on line 14, update the bitcoin\_to\_usd variable value to 25000 and see if your Python program recognises that your investment is below the $30,000 threshold.

## Task 9 Files

#### In the code editor, write Python code to read the flag.txt file. What is the flag in this file?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-19 22-19-12.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{F1LE_R3AD}`
{% endhint %}
