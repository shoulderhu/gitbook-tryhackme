## Task 2 The CIA Triad

#### What element of the CIA triad ensures that data cannot be altered by **unauthorised** people?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Integrity`
{% endhint %}

#### What element of the CIA triad ensures that data is available?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Availability`
{% endhint %}

#### What element of the CIA triad ensures that data is only accessed by **authorised** people

{% hint style="success" %}
`Confidentiality`
{% endhint %}

## Task 3 Principles of Privileges

**Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** is used to translate a user's role within an organization into an access role on a system. Whereas **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.

PAM incorporates more than assigning access. It also encompasses enforcing **security policies** such as password management, auditing policies and reducing the attack surface a system faces.

#### What does the acronym "PIM" stand for?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Privileged Identity Management`
{% endhint %}

#### What does the acronym "PAM" stand for?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Privileged Access Management`
{% endhint %}

#### If you wanted to manage the privileges a system access role had, what methodology would you use?

{% hint style="success" %}
`PAM`
{% endhint %}

#### If you wanted to create a system role that is based on a users role/responsibilities with an organization, what methodology is this?

{% hint style="success" %}
`PIM`
{% endhint %}

## Task 5 Threat Modelling & Incident Response

#### What model outlines "Spoofing"?

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

#### What does the acronym "IR" stand for?

{% hint style="success" %}

{% hint style="success" %}
`Tampering`
{% endhint %}

#### An attacker has penetrated your organisation's security and stolen data. It is your task to return the organisation to business as usual. What incident response stage is this?
